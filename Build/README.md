Using this directory to build andoid .apk files from Unity to.

Steps to run on your Android device:

1. Ensure you have turned on setting for allowing external apps to be installed in your Android device settings area.

2. Install a file explorer app of some kind (I've used ES File Explorer but any will do)

3. You can then transfer the built .apk file across to your phone using the file explorer app, run the .apk file to install the app.

4. Run the app to see how it looks.
